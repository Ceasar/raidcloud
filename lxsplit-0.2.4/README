FILE SPLITTER/JOINER

USAGE

  To put data into cloudbox
  - get file to split from client, put it in /lxsplit-0.2.4/
  - ./splitfile.sh [FILE] [NUM_PARTS]
  - file parts plus parity will be in /tmp/FILE.001, /tmp/FILE.002, /tmp/FILE.par, etc
  - send these files to their respective cloud storage

  To get data from cloudbox
  -  download part files and parity from cloud storage
  - ./autorec.sh [FILE] [NUM_PARTS]
  -  this recovers a missing part file, if any (just run it regardless)
  - ./joinfile.sh ../tmp/[FILE]
  -  the reconstructed file is in /tmp/
  -  send this file to the user 


EXAMPLES

    ./splitfile.sh myfile.txt 4
    Splits myfile.txt into 4 equal pieces, padding the last file with null characters if necessary.
    Also creates a parity file myfile.txt.par

    ./joinfile.sh myfile.txt.001
    Rejoins myfile's various parts, and removes 2 bytes of padding from the end of the final output.
